# Wednesday Deliverables 10/18

## Setup of NeuroData Annotation workflow on annotators' laptops

-*Goal*: Have annotators begin using current annotation workflow to gain feedback on what works and doesn't work.
-*Definition of Done*: Have annotator demo annotation workflow next Monday.
-*Importance*: Actual user feedback is important so we can understand what needs to be improved with the current annotation workflow.


# Complete documentation on annotation workflow

-*Goal*: Have thorough documentation on every step of annotation workflow including pulling data using Inter, annotating with Fiji, and the ingest_large_vol.
-*Definition of Done*: Sphinx html documentation with relevant links, code, and examples.
-*Importance*: Although not perfect, the current annotation workflow is how labels are currently being generated. By providing documentation, we ensure that teams can begin generating and storing annotations into the BOSS as painlessly as possible.
