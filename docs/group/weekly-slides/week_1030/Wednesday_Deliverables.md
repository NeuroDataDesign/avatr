# Wednesday Deliverables 10/30   

## Have Annotators Demo Entire Workflow

-*Goal*: Have annotators learn how the entire annotation workflow works.  
-*Definition of Done*: Have annotator demo next Monday.  
-*Importance*: Actual user feedback is important so we can understand what needs to be improved with the current annotation workflow. This is also the complete annotation pipeline they will probably be using before we iterate.  


## Documentation on ND Web Tools  

-*Goal*: Have good documentation on ND Web Tools.  
-*Definition of Done*: Documentation updated on Read-the-docs.  
-*Importance*: ND Web Tools is a critical step in annotating data. Annotators have suggested getting better documentation on this step so that's what we'll do.  

## Docker NDR and Ingest_Large_Vol?  

-*Goal*: Make installation of annotation pipeline easier.  
-*Definition of Done*: Dockerfile that correctly builds with NDR and Ingest_Large_Vol working.  
-*Importance*: There will always be problems with installation. This will also help with users that don't have a Unix machine.  

## Talk to Jovo about LIMS?

-*Goal*: Start planning out next sprint's work. Maybe not a huge priority right now?   
-*Definition of Done*: Rough draft of components needed in NeuroData LIMS.  
-*Importance*: This is probably going to be our main deliverable for the rest of the semester. Might be a good idea to start thinking about it now if we have time.
