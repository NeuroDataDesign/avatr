# Wednesday Deliverables 10/23  

## Have Annotators Demo Ingest_Large_Vol

-*Goal*: Have annotators begin using current annotation workflow to gain feedback on what works and doesn't work.  
-*Definition of Done*: Have annotator demo ingest_large_vol next Monday.  
-*Importance*: Actual user feedback is important so we can understand what needs to be improved with the current annotation workflow.


## Demo of NeuroDataManager

-*Goal*: Demo using NeuroDataManager to store annotations.  
-*Definition of Done*: Demo and documentation.  
-*Importance*: NeuroDataManager is still in development but has the potential to be used as an API to store annotations and other objects correctly in the cloud. Implementing NDM into groups' pipelines can allow for easy formatted storage of pipeline outputs and annotations.  

## Evaluate what tools we are still missing to create end to end pipeline infrastructure.

-*Goal*: Wireframe sketch of components necessary to have pipeline run correctly using infrastructure tools.   
-*Definition of Done*: Detailed wireframe sketch of how pipeline would work with our infrastructure. Detailed notes on missing components.  
-*Importance*: Our end goal is to have a service of infrastructure tools that fully supports the NeuroData Design pipelines. Now that we have a basic grasp on storage and annotation, I would like to reevaluate what we still need.
